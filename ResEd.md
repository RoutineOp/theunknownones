### What is ResEd ###

ResEd is an expert for Delphi 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010 and XE.

This expert is designed for editing the resource files (.res; .resx) that are linked to the active project. It will automatically search for all occurrences of {$R xyz.res} lines and will open/create resourcefiles for them. The expert registers itself in the menubar of Delphi under View.

### It will ... ###

  * give you a quick overview over all resouce files linked to your project
  * enable you to easily add/remove and edit resources in your project
  * handle the most widely used graphic formats as well as RC and user resources

But as you can guess, this can save a lot of time. For an example watch this video or this video.

### Installation ###

After downloading the file resed\_xxx.zip it is appropriate to extract the included files into a directory of your choice.

Please copy the ResEdxxx.bpl in the folder where you usually lay down the bpl's.

Now you can use the dialog of delphi to install the new package (menu "Components\Install packages"). For Delphi 2006/2007 you will also need to install the TUOScriptxxx.bpl the same way.
For extended DotNet support in BDS 2006/2007 you also may want to copy the ResXEd.dll to the bpl folder.
After installing the package successfully you've got a new menu-item in the menu "View".

### Live-Templates? ###

Since version 1.4 ResEd uses a new Delphi 2006+ feature calles live-templates. Now it is possible to add and create resources without leaving your sourcecode. Simply copy the ready-to-use template xml files into the appropriate folder on your harddisk and play around with them. Because everyone has his own likes and dislikes regarding templates I just added some hints what you can do with them. If you want to create new templates using TUO-Script feel free to do so. You may also send them to us and maybe we will incorporate them within the resed archive.
